Description: Static mesh deformed through vertex shaders and lit using per-pixel bump mapping.

Dependencies used:
CanvasMatrix4.js
GLSL noise algorithm from: https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise/wiki
Textures from: http://www.rendertextures.com/category/water/seamless-water/

Tested with: FireFox, Chrome, and Safari (with WebGL enabled) on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

Details:
On load it generates a static mesh of 80 * 80 * 2 triangles, binds a diffuse texture and a normal texture, and then renders it using a shader that:

1. Generates the tangent and binormal vectors, then the normal vector from it.
2. Transforms camera and light vectors from eye space to tangent space.
3. Pass these values from the vertex shader to the fragment shader.
3. Samples diffuse and normal textures.
4. Calculates light intensities from transformed light/camera vectors and the normal read from texture.
5. Set the result as the fragment color.

By doing this, it results in an animated mesh and texture combination that has per-pixel lighting and bump mapping enabled.
